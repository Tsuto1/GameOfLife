# GameOfLife

 Conway's Game of Life in Godot
 
I made a simulator for this cellular automata in Monogame C# when I was around 14 y/o, but I lost the files so here it is again in Godot.


**Features:**

• Static toolbar that disables canvas input when hovered over (this used to be an issue)

• Draw tool

• Erase tool

• Move/Pan tool



• Tracer cell color for recently dead cells

• Speed slider

• Play/pause tool + shortcut (Space)


**Shortcuts:**
• R - Reset camera's position and zoom level

• C - Clear the canvas of live cells and tracer cells

• G - Show/hide grid on canvas

• Space - Easy reach for play/pause tool
